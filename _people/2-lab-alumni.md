## PhD students at University of Canterbury

### Coley Tosto
<img align="left" src='/images/ColeyTosto.jpg' width="20%" height="20%"> Coley Tosto has completed a Ph.D. in Biological Sciences investigating the role sexual selection pressures have in sex-biased gene expression using pipefish as a model system. Her overall research interests surround the evolution of different mating systems and all the factors that are involved in shaping them. She is working in collaboration with [Heather Masonjones](https://www.ut.edu/directory/masonjones-heather) and [Emily Rose](https://www.valdosta.edu/about/directory/profile/erose).

## Masters students at University of Canterbury


### Georgia Gwatkin

<img align="left" src='/images/GeorgiaGwatkin.jpg' width="30%" height="30%"> Georgia Gwatkin completed a MSc in Biological Sciences, co-supervised by Dr. Sarah Flanagan and [Dr. Michelle LaRue](https://www.drmichellelarue.com/). Georgia’s research focused on investigating the terrestrial habitat preferences and intra-seasonal movements of little penguins/kororā at Flea Bay/Pōhatu, working in collaboration with the Helps Pōhatu Conservation Trust. Her research interests include conservation biology, spatial ecology, and behavioural ecology.

### Ruby O'Neill

<img align="left" src='/images/RubyONeill.jpeg' width="30%" height="30%"> Ruby O'Neill submitted her masters thesis in August 2023. Her thesis focussed on New Zealand pipefish (<i>Stigmatopora macropterygia</i>) and differential gene expression between males and females.

### Lucy Howell

<img align="right" src='/images/lucyhowell.png' width="40%" height="40%"> Lucy completed her Masters in Antarctic Studies, working with Sarah and [Michelle LaRue](https://www.drmichellelarue.com/). Lucy is now a [Aho Hīnātore/Accelerator Scholarship](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/postgraduate/aho-hinatore-accelerator-scholarship/) PhD student with [Tammy Steeves](http://www.ucconsert.org/people/).

### Fleur van Eyndhoven

<img align="right" src='/images/fleurvaneyndhoven.jpg' width="40%" height="40%"> Fleur completed her Master of Science with Sarah in 2022,  looking at sexual selection in the wide-bodied pipefish, <i>Stigmatopora nigra</i>. She is interested in animal behaviour and how individuals interact with each other. 



### Micaela Pullen

<img align="left" src='/images/MicaelaPullen.jpg' height='100' width='133'> Micaela completed her masters of science with Sarah in 2021, working on monitoring a population of pipefish that reside in seagrass beds in Duvauchelle Bay. More generally, she is interested in how organisms influence each other and the environment around them.

## Honours students at University of Canterbury

### Analese Fon

<img align="right" src='/images/AnaleseFon.jpeg' width="30%" height="30%"> Analese is a student currently working towards a Bachelor of Environmental Science majoring in Ecosystem Health and Biosecurity at the University of Canterbury. Her honours research project aims to investigate the use of drones as a non-invasive monitoring tool to understand the behaviours of endangered humpback whales (*Megaptera noaeangliae*). Co-supervised by Sarah Flanagan and [Travis Horton](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/contact-us/people/travis-horton.html), Analese's research interests are animal behaviour and conservation biology.

### Sophie Shannon

Sophie completed her BSc (Hons) with [Dr Daniel Stouffer](https://stoufferlab.org/people/stouffer/), [Professor Mike Plank](https://www.math.canterbury.ac.nz/~m.plank/), and Sarah. She evaluated how different models of tree growth and mortality impact predictions of forest size that are important for estimating the amount of carbon sequestered by that stand of trees -- which directly impacts estimates of carbon offsetting by tree planting.


## Summer scholarship students at University of Canterbury

### Ella Peoples

<img align="right" src='/images/EllaPeoples.jpeg' width="30%" height="30%"> Ella Peoples worked on little blue penguins/kororā and the Ixodes ticks which parasitize them. The ticks are also vector for pathogens which may pose a conservation risk to the kororā if an outbreak should occur. This project involved developing and optimizing a method to screen ticks for pathogens. Her research interests are stable isotopes ecology, genetics, conservation biology and environmental toxicology, particularly in marine ecosystems.

### Myles Landon

Myles worked with Coley and Emily on a comparative analysis of pipefish mating systems. He was about to begin his third year as a Biochemistry Major at the University of Canterbury and was excited to have hands-on laboratory experience on a research project outside of the classroom. 

### Jude van Houtte

<img align="right" src='/images/jude-flanagan lab.jpg' width="20%" height="20%"> Jude is an undergraduate student working towards her BSc, majoring in Biological Science. She worked as a summer research student in 2021-2022, where in collaboration with Emily Beasley studying sexual selection and behaviour in sex-role-reversed pipefish. She is interested in conservation, ethology, and evolution, as well as mātauranga Māori and the connection between science and people.

### Other summer students 

2022-2023: Georgia Gwatkin and Alexandra Strang worked with Sarah and [Michelle LaRue](https://www.drmichellelarue.com/) in a collaborative project with Pōhatu Penguins, conducting conservation monitoring of kororā and performing a literature review on research conducted in Akaroa Harbour.

2019-2020: Averill Moser-Rust worked with Mads Thomsen, Micaela Pullen, Derek Gerber, and Sarah, investigating the community of fishes in two  seagrass beds in the Canterbury region in New Zealand.

2018-2019: Chavvah Freeman worked with Sarah, studying the evolution of pigmentation genes in pipefish.

## Visiting scholars

### Xaver Bartels

Xaver Bartels is an MSc student at the University of Amsterdam who visited the Flanagan lab for 8 months for his internship in 2024. He studied courtship behaviours in pipefish. Specifically, Xaver tested whether male pipefish prefer larger females or smaller females in <i>Stigmatopora nigra</i>.

### Kathryn Blankely

Kathryn was a Royal Society of New Zealand Science Teaching Leadership Programme fellow co-supervised by Sarah Flanagan and Rob Cruickshank in 2024.

## NIMBioS SRE 2017

Dr. Flanagan co-supervised four undergraduate students with Dr. Nourridine Siewe at NIMBioS during the Summer Research Experience program in 2017.
The group included Sharee Brewer (Fisk University), Kimberly Dautel (Marist College), Alan Liang (Cornell University), and Brian Lerch (Case Western Reserve University), and [we have publisehd the results of our summer working together!](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1438-390X.12047)
