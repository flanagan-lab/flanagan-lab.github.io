## Honours students at University of Canterbury

### Analese Fon

<img align="right" src='/images/AnaleseFon.jpeg' width="30%" height="30%"> Analese is a student currently working towards a Bachelor of Environmental Science majoring in Ecosystem Health and Biosecurity at the University of Canterbury. Her honours research project aims to investigate the use of drones as a non-invasive monitoring tool to understand the behaviours of endangered humpback whales (*Megaptera noaeangliae*). Co-supervised by Sarah Flanagan and [Travis Horton](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/contact-us/people/travis-horton.html), Analese's research interests are animal behaviour and conservation biology.


## Summer scholarship students at University of Canterbury

### Jude van Houtte

<img align="right" src='/images/jude-flanagan lab.jpg' width="20%" height="20%"> Jude is an undergraduate student working towards her BSc, majoring in Biological Science. She worked as a summer research student in 2021-2022, where in collaboration with Emily Beasley studying sexual selection and behaviour in sex-role-reversed pipefish. She is interested in conservation, ethology, and evolution, as well as mātauranga Māori and the connection between science and people.

### Other summer students 

2022-2023: Georgia Gwatkin and Alexandra Strang worked with Sarah and [Michelle LaRue](https://www.drmichellelarue.com/) in a collaborative project with Pōhatu Penguins, conducting conservation monitoring of kororā and performing a literature review on research conducted in Akaroa Harbour.

2019-2020: Averill Moser-Rust worked with Mads Thomsen, Micaela Pullen, Derek Gerber, and Sarah, investigating the community of fishes in two  seagrass beds in the Canterbury region in New Zealand.

2018-2019: Chavvah Freeman worked with Sarah, studying the evolution of pigmentation genes in pipefish.

## NIMBioS SRE 2017

Dr. Flanagan co-supervised four undergraduate students with Dr. Nourridine Siewe at NIMBioS during the Summer Research Experience program in 2017.
The group included Sharee Brewer (Fisk University), Kimberly Dautel (Marist College), Alan Liang (Cornell University), and Brian Lerch (Case Western Reserve University), and [we have publisehd the results of our summer working together!](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1438-390X.12047)
