### I AM SEEKING A POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER

<img src='/images/IMG_3174.JPG'>

I am seeking a post-doctoral candidate to contribute to research investigating population genomics of emperor penguins in the Ross Sea. The position is funded for 20 months at the University of Canterbury and includes laboratory-based work (DNA extractions; sequencing library preparations) and analysis of genome-wide population genetic datasets. Project start date is negotiable, but aiming for mid-year 2025.

I am looking for a self-starting, motivated colleague who is interested in the genetics, evolution, and conservation of animals adapted to living in extreme habitats. PhD required, with background in population genetics, evolution, and molecular ecology; competency with standard laboratory techniques and analyses using bash scripting and/or R is essential; strong writing skills, ability to adapt/learn quickly, and experience engaging with science communication are a major plus. The successful candidate will be working with a multi-national team (including the Korean Polar Research Institute), so a collaborative attitude is a necessity. 
Potential candidates who identify with groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences are especially encouraged to apply. If you have questions or are interested in the position, please [email Sarah Flanagan (sarah.flanagan@canterbury.ac.nz)](sarah.flanagan@canterbury.ac.nz) and attach your CV.

The position will be open until filled.

**The Flanagan lab:** My group studies how and why complex traits and behaviours evolve, with a focus on sexually selected traits. We use a number of different methods to address these broad questions: studies of relevant traits and selection on those traits; genomic studies of signatures of selection; and theoretical simulation studies. 

My lab is inclusive, welcoming, and committed to advancing diversity; I welcome everyone regardless of their nationality, ethnicity, colour, socioeconomic background, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, and age. I especially encourage members of historically underrepresented groups including (but not limited to) people of colour, women, veterans, and people from socioeconomically disadvantaged communities to inquire about opportunities and apply to join my group. 

**The University:** The University of Canterbury is located in Christchurch, the largest city in New Zealand's South Island. The University has approximately 22,000 students enrolled. The University's modern and well-equipped facilities are spread across a spacious suburban campus, with easy access to the city and the cultural and recreational facilities it provides. There is also good access to the scenic and recreational resources of the Southern Alps and Banks Peninsula.  

Information about other general opportunities to join my group can be found [here](https://flanagan-lab.github.io/people/join).
