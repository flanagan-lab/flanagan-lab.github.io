<b>About the lab</b>

The Flanagan Lab in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch is focused on understanding the evolutionary mechanisms allowing variation in traits to be maintained within and among populations. Specifically, we are interested in understanding the evolution of sexually dimorphic traits (why are males and different in some species and not other closely related species?) and identifying mechanisms impacting fitness-related traits (what evolutionary mechanisms and which traits are involved in population declines?). We use a wide variety of tools to address these questions, including population genetics, comparative genomics, transcriptomics, animal behaviour, and simulation modeling. Our empirical work has mostly focused on pipefish and seahorses, but we are also studying kororā (little blue penguins) and pathogenic oomycetes.


<b>Lab news</b>

July 2022: The lab has published our first data paper! It is titled "Seasonal dynamics of faunal diversity and population ecology in an estuarine seagrass bed" and is published in *Estuaries and Coasts*. This is the first paper from Micaela Pullen's MSc (completed in 2021). You can read the paper for free from [Estuaries and Coasts](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12237-022-01103-8.pdf).

June 2022: Sarah was spoke about the group's research (especially the research on kororā, the little blue penguins) on Radio New Zealand's Nights with Bryan Crump. [You can listen to the segment as a podcast if you missed it live!](https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/nights/audio/2018845123/native-species-and-climate-change)

June 2022: Lucy Howell won the Best Poster Award at the New Zealand Birds Conference! You can view her poster [here](https://github.com/flanagan-lab/flanagan-lab.github.io/blob/493e683b96bfc95c83592f1f9d74d0c6e4cb9db0/pdfs/LHowell_OSNZ_poster(1).pdf).

June 2022: Didi Daley has joined the lab to start a MSc on the population genetics of wide-bodied pipefish!

May 2022: The research team has received funding from the Brian Mason Trust to hire a summer student to work with the research team and our collaborators at Pohatu Penguins. UC students, reach out if you are interested!

March 2022: Fleur van Eyndhoven submitted her MSc thesis. Congratulations, Fleur!

February 2022: The research team has received funding from the University of Canterbury's Vision Mātauranga Fund and UC's Faculty of Science New Ideas Seed grant to support the collaborative research with Ōnuku Rūnanga and Pohatu Penguins, supporting Lucy Howell's PhD research.

Januray 2022: Coley Tosto, who began her PhD in November 2020, finally arrived in New Zealand to complete the remainder of her PhD!

Check out how Sarah spent her time in 2021 [in her latest blog post!](https://sarahpflanagan.wordpress.com/2022/01/04/working-in-the-age-of-lockdowns/)

December 2021: Sarah was awarded UC's Faculty of Science Emerging Researcher Award!

November 2021: Emily Beasley has joined the lab as a new PhD student, and we are also welcoming Jude van Houtte as a summer student! Starting in mid-November are two co-supervised students, Alexandra Cox (MSc) and Andrew McCabe (summer BSc student), who co-supervised by Sarah and [Claudia Meisrimler](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/contact-us/people/claudia-meisrimler.html).

September 2021: Lucy Howell has started her PhD  in the lab!

March 2021: Lucy Howell's first paper from her masters research has been published in the New Zealand Journal of Zoology. It is a [review paper on using environmental DNA to monitor Antarctic vertebrates](https://doi-org.ezproxy.canterbury.ac.nz/10.1080/03014223.2021.1900299).

March 2021: Sarah has published a paper on [the genetic basis of freshwater adaptation in pipefish](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.canterbury.ac.nz/doi/10.1111/mec.15841). 

February 2021: Fleur van Eyndhoven is continuing her summer scholarship research on pipefish behaviour in her MSc research. She has already filmed >200 hours of pipefish behaviours!
