<b>About the lab</b>

The Flanagan Lab in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch is focused on understanding the evolutionary mechanisms allowing variation in traits to be maintained within and among populations. Specifically, we are interested in understanding the evolution of sexually dimorphic traits (why are males and different in some species and not other closely related species?) and identifying mechanisms impacting fitness-related traits (what evolutionary mechanisms and which traits are involved in population declines?). We use a wide variety of tools to address these questions, including population genetics, comparative genomics, transcriptomics, animal behaviour, and simulation modeling. Our empirical work has mostly focused on pipefish and seahorses, but we are also studying kororā (little blue penguins), paikea (humpback whales), and pathogenic oomycetes.


<b>Lab news</b>

January 2023: Sarah was interviewed on the RNZ Morning Report to talk about the recent pipefish research. [You can listen to the short conversation here!](https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/morningreport/audio/2018922246/nz-pipefish-stand-out)

January 2023: Sarah wrote [an article for The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/male-pregnancy-and-weird-courtship-wiggles-how-nzs-wide-bodied-pipefish-confounds-expectations-216618) about the lab's recently published research on wide-bodied pipefish behaviour.

December 2023: [Nan Hauser](https://whaleresearch.org/about-us/) has enrolled at UC for the last year of her PhD, funded by a UC Sustainability Development Scholarship, under the supervision of Sarah and [Travis Horton](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/contact-us/people/travis-horton.html).

April 2023: Coley's undergraduate research was published in Frontiers in Marine Science, titled ["The development of a quantification method for measuring iridescence using sexually selected traits in the Gulf pipefish (_Syngnathus scovelli_)"](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2023.1127790/full), with her co-supervisors Emily Rose and Heather Mason. 

April 2023: Juan Lee was awarded a UC Doctoral Scholarship to do his PhD with Sarah, studying pipefish evolution. He arrived from South Korea and will be starting his PhD in May.

April 2023: Analese Fon has joined the lab as a BSc(Hons) student, co-supervised by Travis Horton, and is studying humpback whale behaviour. 

March 2023: Alex Cox has submitted her MSc thesis. Congratulations Alex! Alex will be staying on as a PhD student. 

March 2023: The team has had a paper published in Nature Ecology & Evolution, titled ["The roles of sexual selection and sexual conflict in shaping patterns of genome and transcriptome variation"](https://rdcu.be/c8jST), with collaborators Bob Wong and Judith Mank.

February 2023: Emily has returned from 6 months living and working in Melbourne, Australia, with her co-supervisor Prof. Bob Wong. We're glad to have her back in Christchurch!

December 2022: Sarah, Coley, and Emily attended the Australasian Evolution Society conference in Canberra, and all three gave talks about our research on pipefish. Reach out if you want to know more about our preliminary results!
