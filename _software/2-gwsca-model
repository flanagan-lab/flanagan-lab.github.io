This is a C++ program that simulates SNP data based on a number of parameters, and simulates various sex-specific selection pressures. The source code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/spflanagan/gwsca_simulation_model). 

This simulation program was published in ["Identifying signatures of sexual selection using genome-wide selection components analysis" in Ecology and Evolution](https://doi.org/10.1002%2Fece3.1546).
